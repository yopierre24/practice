Ensure HTTPS is selected and click the copy button to copy the remote repository URL.
In Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Mac, Linux)

Navigate to the folder where the repository should be cloned into.
Issue the git clone command followed by pasting the previously copied remote repository URL.
Change directory to the newly created repository folder. (Folder name is the same as the remote repository name)
Set your user name and email using the git config command. E.g. git config user.name "your name" and git config user.email "your email address".
Check that the correct username and email is set using the git config -l command.
Setting and checking user.name and user.email must to be done every time the remote repository is cloned to a local repository.

Create a branch named develop off the main branch. E.g. git branch develop
Switch to the develop branch. E.g. git checkout develop
Push the branch to the remote repository. E.g. git push -u origin develop Creation of files should not start until the develop branch has been pushed to the remote repository.
